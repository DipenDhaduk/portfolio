Whether you’re trying to get back in shape, impress the office by doing a marathon or are a seasoned runner with many an ultra under your belt, you’ve definitely felt the pull of the sofa, or looked out the window at a cold, wet and dark world only to decide your goals can wait for tomorrow.

- See runners near you. Find and like people you want to run with and don’t worry, we’ll only show you profiles we think are a good fitness match.

- Match time! When they like you back, it’s over to you. See if you get along and then strap on your running shoes and hit the road.

- It takes a village. Some runs are fast and fitness-focused while others are slower and just about getting a sweat on. Find different running partners as your goals evolve.
